<font size="3"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-weight: 400">Modern 
mobile phones can obtain high-quality pamlprint images. Palmprint actually is 
very robust to kinds of variations and is more secure than face. However, its 
potentiality for commerce has not been fully investigated. Consider someday you 
will have an online payment system by scanning palmprint. It's cool!!</span></font></h2>
<p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-weight: 400">In this 
project, your task is to implement a palmprint verification 
system based on your mobile phone. Your project can be a cloud-client based 
architecture or can totally run on a mobile-phone. </span></font></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Calibri">Quite recently, our group has studied this 
problem and published a large-scale dataset. For more information, you can visit
