on generating parking-slot image samples (Tutor: Juntao Chen 158 0175 8610)</b></font></p>
<h2>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;">
Introduction</span></h2>
<h2>
<font size="3"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-weight: 400">Domain 
adaptation is a hot research topic in the fields of machine learning and 
computer vision. Roughly speaking, methods in this area can be categorized into 
two classes, pixel-level ones and feature-level ones. Image-level domain 
adaptation aims to learn the mapping between different visual domains. It is 
quite useful for augmenting training sets. In this project, your task is to 
complete a system which can create virtual parking-slot image samples that are 
realistic looking. </span></font></h2>
<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Calibri'">Requirements</span></h2>
<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Calibri'">1&gt; Develop a virtual parking-slot image 
generation system using Unity. Taking a real road image as the texture. Then, 
feed the texture into Unity. Your system is expected to create various 
parking-slot image samples by adjusting the lighting conditions, the trees, the 
objects nearby, and the&nbsp; parking-lines.</span></p>

Virtual image samples may be not as real as samples collected from the real 
world. So, you need to use GAN-based domain adaptation technologies to improve 
their reality. You may try the following suggested candidate solutions: 1) 
Learning from simulated and unsupervised images through adversarial training, 
CVPR 2017; 2) Unsupervised pixel-level domain adaptation with generative 
adversarial networks, CVPR 2017; 3) Diverse image-to-image translation via 
disentangled representations, ECCV 2018. To train GAN-based pixel-level domain 
adaptation networks, you may need to use real parking-slot image samples, which 
can be obtained here <a href="https://cslinzhang.github.io/deepps/">
